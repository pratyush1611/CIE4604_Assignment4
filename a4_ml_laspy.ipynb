(iv) Visualize your final subset, including the useful observed features. (vi) Describe your at least four different object classes; For each point determine neighborhoods of k1, k2, ... points (using e.g. an efficient data structure), and use these k1, k2, ... points to estimate several feature values.\n",

Indicate for each feature how it could help to distinguish your classes, given also the neighborhood sizes you consider.\n",
